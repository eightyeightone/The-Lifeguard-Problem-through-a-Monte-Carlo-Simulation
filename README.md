## The Lifeguard Problem through a Monte Carlo Simulation


#### Abstract
A Monte Carlo simulation is a predictive tool used when numerical solutions are expensive to produce or to assist human intuition. This report uses these methods to solve The Lifeguard Problem. That is, where should the lifeguard enter the water to reach the drowning child fastest, as (s)he is faster on-land than in the water. Through ten simulations the results varied from the optimum (178m) by Â±9m with one simulation resulting the optimum. Future work will include stock price forecasting.
