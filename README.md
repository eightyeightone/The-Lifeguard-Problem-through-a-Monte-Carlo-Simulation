## The Lifeguard Problem through a Monte Carlo Simulation

#### Summary
This project was written as an introduction to Monte Carlo Simulations using a simple objective function. A simple function with only one dependent and one independent variable was used. The random samples generated from the independent varirable were uniformally distributed and represented points in which the lifeguard could enter the water. The simulations showed how these randomly generated values effected the total time to reach the drowning child and how accuracte the Monte Carlo Simulation is. Distribution of the results from the optimum (178m) was &plusmn9m.
